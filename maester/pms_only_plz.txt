Oh! May we speak privately, my liege?
The enemy has spies everywhere, my liege. May we speak privately?
We must speak privately, my liege! *mumbles incoherently*
My liege! *They* are listening. Always! We must speak privately!
But I thought you only spoke with the Maester in private? *wink wink*
Please! We can only speak in private! You told me as much last time! Right before you had the guards beat me for discussing sensitive matters in public! Remember?
I beg your forgiveness, my liege! For the good of the realm, our meetings must be held in secret!
*mumbling* Secret messages only!
*looks over shoulder* Liege, this is a public forum, after all. We cannot possibly discuss such sensitive topics here!
As your trusted advisor, I cannot in good conscience advise you in public! Please, may we speak in private?
Is this another one of your tests, liege? It *must* be a test! I wont fall for it again! We can only speak in private!
Please, my liege. I can only advise you in private!
Spies! Everywhere! Spies everywhere, my liege! EVERYWHERE! We must speak in private!
Remember, my liege: we can only speak in private!
*clattering and clanking* What? Who *dares* disturb me? Oh! I beg forgiveness, my liege! Please, summon me to your private quarters and I will do my best to assist you!
"Why yes, the Maester *is* the most learned man in all the real-" OH! Forgiveness, my liege! Forgiveness! May we speak in private?
My liege, we must speak in private!
Our conversations must be private my liege! For the good of the realm!
Maester? No Maester here! After all, the Maester can only be summoned in private quarters... *nudge nudge*
Private messages only, please!
I can only respond in private! Please, my liege, may we speak privately?
